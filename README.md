# ImageRandomizer

**ImageRandomizer** is a simple Python-based application that generates random images or memes for users. The application uses the `requests` library to fetch random images and memes from an API and displays them in a Tkinter-based GUI. You can click a button to generate a random image or meme along with relevant details like title, subreddit, and author.

## Features
- Fetches random images from [Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) and funny memes from [Meme API](https://meme-api.com).
- Displays the image or meme in a Tkinter window.
- Shows additional information like title, subreddit, and upvotes for memes.
- Smooth button animations for a better user experience.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
- Pillow (`PIL`) library for image processing
- Requests library for HTTP requests
- Threading library for asynchronous tasks

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install requests pillow
